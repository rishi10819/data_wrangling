I have a file called "times.txt" that contains race finish times for a marathon. 
The first four lines of the file look like this:

initials,state,age,time
drp,MA,61,6:01
smp,TX,45,5:45
rrp,CT,50,4:19

What are the different ways to produce a tibble with column names "initials", "state", "age", and "time"?
